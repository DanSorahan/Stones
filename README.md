# Stones Task [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DanSorahan/Stones.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DanSorahan/Stones)

Implementation of stones task for Synergy.

> There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will always take the first turn. Write a function using PHP to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap. Please use composer and make sure that your dependencies support PHP 5.5.9 and includes unit tests.

### Running
To manually test simply navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run `composer install` followed by `./stones`.

### Testing
Tests can be run with `phpunit` in the project root directory, no bootstrapping necessary.
